Environmental Segregation
This project looks at the impact of segregation on environmental conditions.
Types of segregation include: racial, ethnic, age, gender, health access, and income clusters.
Correlation, geostatitics, and temporal analysis will be conducted

Notes:
environmental factors include: (1) PM 2.5 Level in Air; (2) Ozone Level in Air; (3) Diesel Particulate Matter Level in Air; (4) Air Toxics Cancer Risk; (5) Air Toxics Neurological Hazard Index; (6) Air Toxics Respiratory Hazard Index; (7) Traffic Proximity and Volume; (8) Lead Paint Indicator (% pre- 1960); (9) Risk Management Plan Facility Proximity; (10) Superfund Site Proximity; (11) Treatment Storage Disposal Facility Proximity; and (12) Major Direct Dischargers to Water Proximity. In addition to
environmental factors, the tool also uses two primary demographic factors, specifically, percentage of the population that is minority and percentage of population that is and low-income.
